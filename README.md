<h1>Lil Botty</h1>
<h5>I built the bones to this bot in the span of 12 hours in a rush, made it for function not to look good. It is no longer supported, and would need to be seriously redone to be of any use</h5>
Simple & Open Source bot originally created for the MCCTF Community (https://www.brawl.com/), then further expand to become a general use bot
